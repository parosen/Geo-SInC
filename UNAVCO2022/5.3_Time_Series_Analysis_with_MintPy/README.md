# Time Series Analysis with MintPy
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.1

Resource: smallbaselineApp_aria.ipynb in section 5.2

Expected Outcome: Develop an intuition in running and examining the results from MintPy

Assessment: 

1. Re-process a InSAR time-series (using the same San Francisco Bay dataset or a dataset of your choice) using smallbaselineApp, with the following:

   - Manually choose a reference point, with justifications of your choices.
   - Tropospheric correction of your choice [account setup is needed for pyaps/ERA5]
   - Solid Earth tides correction

2. Estimate a suite of time functions for the final displacement time-series, using time functions of your choice, e.g. annual, semi-annual (periodic functions), step functions, etc.
