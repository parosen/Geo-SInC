# SAR Theory Phenomenology
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TA’s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.0

Resource: SAR.ipynb 

Expected Outcome: Students learn the basics of phenomenology, including speckle, radar equation, wavelength dependence, polarization, layover, shadow 

Assessment: Exercises to alter the notebooks provided to look for specific results (e.g. speckle filtering, processing bandwidth, radar equation changes of range, etc.).
