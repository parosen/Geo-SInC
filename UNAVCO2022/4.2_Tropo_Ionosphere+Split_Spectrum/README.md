# Tropo + Ionosphere + Split Spectrum
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TA’s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.0

Resource: stripmapApp_ionosphere.ipynb, Tropo.ipynb

Expected Outcome: Develop and understanding of the typical signatures of the troposphere and ionosphere in InSAR data, its spatial and temporal variability, wavelength dependence (or not), ways to estimate or model, and expected improvements.

Assessment: Execute the self-directed notebook and inspect the result
