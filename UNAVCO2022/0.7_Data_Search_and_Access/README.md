# Data Search and Access
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TA’s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.0

Resource: SSARA.ipynb, GRFN.ipynb

Expected Outcome: Students know the SAR platforms collecting data, where relevant SAR data can be found (data files, orbits, ancillary datasets like DEMs) , and understand how to get access to the data and which tools are available to do so (SSARA, Vertex, ARIA Tools…). Students also learn how to intelligently limit the search to just the frames they want

Assessment: Short exercise to download ALOS and S-1 data with filters to students know how to get just the frames they want, and no extras. Student self-assessment of comfort level
