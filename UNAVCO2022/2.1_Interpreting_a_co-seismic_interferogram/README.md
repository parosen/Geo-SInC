# Interpreting InSAR

2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.1

Resource: Interpreting InSAR data.ipynb

Expected Outcome: Become familiar with wrapped phase, noise properties of interferograms, how to unwrap by hand and relate it to the deformation event.

Assessment: Homework #2 on modeling. Here, the student needs to interpret the results and describe the confidence of the inverted parameters based on the quality of the input.

Notebook and associated files for an exercise in InSAR data interpretation. As developed for the 2020 UNAVCO short course, <a href="https://www.unavco.org/education/professional-development/short-courses/2020/insar-theory-processing/insar-theory-processing.html">InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE), ARIA Tools, and MintPy</a>.

This exercise was adapted by Gareth Funning (gareth@ucr.edu) from an exercise originally developed by Tim Wright of the University of Leeds. A longer, and more geological, form of the exercise is found in Unit 3 of the GETSI module, 'Imaging Active Tectonics', available at https://serc.carleton.edu/getsi/
