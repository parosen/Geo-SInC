# Raster Data Tiling + Map Projections
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TA’s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.0

Resource: Raster Data Manipulation Video and Map Projection Video linked on syllabus

Expected Outcome: Develop an understanding of manipulation of raster image data and their metadata, including the reasons data sets are projected in different ways to better capture a particular aspect of a spherical data set represented in a 2-dimensional space, most important projections, how to transform between projections.

Assessment: In class manipulation of tiled data converting between specified projections in a notebook.
