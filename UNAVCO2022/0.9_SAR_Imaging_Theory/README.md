# SAR Imaging Theory
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TA’s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.0

Resource: SAR_Processor.ipynb

Expected Outcome: Students learn the basics of SAR imaging by processing an image step by step from simulated raw data to full imagery using range-doppler and backprojection focusing methods.

Assessment: Alter some parameter and plot final impulse response; student needs to figure out which parameter based on problem
