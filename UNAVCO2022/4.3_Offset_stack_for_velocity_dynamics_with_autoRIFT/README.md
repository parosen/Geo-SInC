# Offset stack for velocity dynamics
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.1

Resource: Module resources

Expected Outcome: Use a stack of interferograms or offset fields to infer a multi-dimensional (2D or 3D) velocity time-series. We will cover some methods for separating velocity components, separating short and long timescales, and quantifying uncertainties.

Assessment: Execute the self-directed notebook and respond to prompts
