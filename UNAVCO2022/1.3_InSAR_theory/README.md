# InSAR Theory
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TA’s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.0

Resource: InSAR.ipynb, Correlation.ipynb, Interpreting InSAR data.ipynb

Expected Outcome: A working knowledge of the geometric aspects of InSAR; the relationship between range change, phase change, and surface displacement or topography, critical baseline and other interferometric performance metrics and influencers; the rudiments of interferometric correlation and its utility in error analysis or change mapping

Assessment: Problem set to alter parameters in the notebook to see the effects of changes on interferometric performance

Notebook and associated files for an exercise in InSAR data interpretation. As developed for the 2021 UNAVCO short course, <a href="https://www.unavco.org/education/professional-development/short-courses/2020/insar-theory-processing/insar-theory-processing.html">InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE), ARIA Tools, and MintPy</a>.

This exercise was adapted by Gareth Funning (gareth@ucr.edu) from an exercise originally developed by Tim Wright of the University of Leeds. A longer, and more geological, form of the exercise is found in Unit 3 of the GETSI module, 'Imaging Active Tectonics', available at https://serc.carleton.edu/getsi/
