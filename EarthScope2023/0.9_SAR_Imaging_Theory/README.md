# SAR Imaging Theory

**Resource:** SAR_Processor.ipynb

**Expected Outcome:** Students learn the basics of SAR imaging by processing an image step by step from simulated raw data to full imagery using range-doppler and backprojection focusing methods.

**Assessment:** Alter some parameters and plot the final impulse response; students need to figure out which parameter based on the problem
