    "# Manipulating Layers of ARIA standard GUNW products\n",

    "**Author**: Brett A. Buzzanga, David Bekaert - Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of the functionality included in the **ariaExtract.py** program. Specifically, we give examples on how to extract data and meta-data layers from ARIA Geocoded UNWrapped interferogram (GUNW) products over a user defined area of interest. In addition, we provide an overview of the methodology applied to manipulate specific data and meta-data layers. In this notebook, we use GUNW products spanning the start of the 2018 Hawaii rifting event. \n",

    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to extract:\n",
    "- Product bounding boxes\n",
    "- Imaging geometry layers (i.e., azimuth angle, incidence angle, look angle, perpendicular baseline)\n",
    "- Data layers (i.e., amplitude, coherence, unwrapped phase, and connected components)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide examples on the various methods of defining a spatial area of interest:\n",
    "- Union (in space and time) of all products \n",
