# Offset stack for velocity dynamics

**Resource:** Module resources

**Expected Outcome:** Use a stack of interferograms or offset fields to infer a multi-dimensional (2D or 3D) velocity time-series. We will cover some methods for separating velocity components, separating short and long timescales, and quantifying uncertainties.

**Assessment:** Execute the self-directed notebook and respond to prompts
