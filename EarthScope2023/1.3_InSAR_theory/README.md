# InSAR Theory

**Resource:**

+ InSAR.ipynb
+ Correlation.ipynb

**Expected Outcome:** A working knowledge of the geometric aspects of InSAR; the relationship between range change, phase change, and surface displacement or topography, critical baseline and other interferometric performance metrics and influencers; the rudiments of interferometric correlation and its utility in error analysis or change mapping

**Assessment:** Problem set to alter parameters in the notebook to see the effects of changes on interferometric performance
