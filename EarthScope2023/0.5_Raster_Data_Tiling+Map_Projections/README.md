# Raster Data Tiling + Map Projections

**Resource:** Raster Data Manipulation Video and Map Projection Video linked on the syllabus

**Expected Outcome:** Develop an understanding of the manipulation of raster image data and their metadata, including the reasons data sets are projected in different ways to better capture a particular aspect of a spherical data set represented in a 2-dimensional space, most important projections, how to transform between projections.

**Assessment:** In-class manipulation of tiled data converting between specified projections in a notebook.
