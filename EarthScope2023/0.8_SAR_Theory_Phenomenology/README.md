# SAR Theory Phenomenology

**Resource:** SAR.ipynb 

**Expected Outcome:** Students learn the basics of phenomenology, including speckle, radar equation, wavelength dependence, polarization, layover, shadow 

**Assessment:** Exercises to alter the notebooks provided to look for specific results (e.g. speckle filtering, processing bandwidth, radar equation changes of range, etc.).
