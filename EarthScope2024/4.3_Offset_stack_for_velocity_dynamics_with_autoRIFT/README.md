# Offset stack for velocity dynamics

**Resource:** Module resources

**Expected Outcome:** Generate dense offset fields from stacks of co-registed Sentinel-1 SLCs using ISCE dense offsets module and autoRIFT package. Discuss utility of dense offsets compared to InSAR phase.

**Assessment:** Execute the self-directed notebook and respond to prompts
