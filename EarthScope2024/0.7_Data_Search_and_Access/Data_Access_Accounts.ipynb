We will be using data from both the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) DAAC and the Land Processes (LP DAAC), so you need to register for an EarthData account to complete many parts of the course. In addition, you need to accept some license agreements to have access to Sentinel-1, ALOS, and GRFN data that is all stored at the ASF DAAC. The SRTM and NASADEM topography data do not require license agreements.\n",
