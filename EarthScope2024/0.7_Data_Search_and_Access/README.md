# Data Search and Access

**Resource:**

+ Data_Access_Accounts.ipynb
+ GRFN.ipynb
+ SSARA.ipynb

Start with the `Data_Access_Accounts.ipynb` to see the required accounts. If you don't already have EarthData or OpenTopography accounts, then you need to register as described there.

**Expected Outcome:** Students know the SAR platforms collecting data, where relevant SAR data can be found (data files, orbits, ancillary datasets like DEMs), and understand how to get access to the data and which tools are available to do so (SSARA, Vertex, ARIA Toolsâ€¦). Students also learn how to intelligently limit the search to just the frames they want

**Assessment:** Short exercise to download ALOS and S-1 data with filters to students know how to get just the frames they want, and no extras. Student self-assessment of comfort level
