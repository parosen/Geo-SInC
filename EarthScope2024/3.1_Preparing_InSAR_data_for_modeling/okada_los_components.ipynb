    "\n",
    "This notebook makes use of the derivation of the expected deformation field for slip on a rectangular dislocation (a fault) in an isotropic elastic half space, that was <a href=\"https://www.bosai.go.jp/information/pdf/copy_of_Okada_1985_BSSA.pdf\">originally published by Yoshimitsu Okada in 1985</a>. This model has become synonymous with its author, so much so that we often refer to it simply as 'Okada'. Although is is a huge simplification of nature (Earth surface is assumed to be flat, the strength of the crust is assumed to be uniform, and any faults are assumed to be rectuangular and planar), the Okada model is very commonly used because it is analytical -- the solution is exact and it can be computed very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step with using the Okada model is to convert our fault parameters into the form that the model is expecting. The model geometry, taken here from the <a href=\"https://www.bosai.go.jp/information/dc3d_e.html\">web page on the model</a> hosted at the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience in Japan, defines a coordinate system with its origin at a reference point on the fault.\n",

In this case, the along-strike dimensions parameters AL1 and AL2 are equal in magnitude (half of the along-strike length), as are the down-dip dimensions AW1 and AW2 (half of the down-dip width).
