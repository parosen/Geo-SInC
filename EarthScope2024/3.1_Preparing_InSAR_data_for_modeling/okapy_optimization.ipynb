For complicated functions, such as the penalty function of an Okada model fitted to InSAR data that contain noise (our situation!) it is usually the case that there are several, or perhaps many such minima. It's analous to finding the deepest point on the surface of the Moon, by always taking the steepest path downhill. Eventually, you will walk into a crater, and find your way to the bottom of it. But what if two craters over, there is a deeper one?\n",

    "The problem of finding a 'global minimum' of the penalty function, corresponding to the best-fitting of all possible models, is not straightforward or exact. Following the crater analogy, it can be very dependent on your starting location &ndash; sometimes you need to start away from smaller holes in order to walk into bigger ones! Which is why, when we set up this optimization problem, we randomized our starting guess of the answer. You also have to be careful to specify solution bounds large enough that the neighborhood of the best answer is covered. \n",
