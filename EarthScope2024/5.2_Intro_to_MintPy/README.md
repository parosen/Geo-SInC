# Intro to MintPy

**Resource:** smallbaselineApp_aria.ipynb

**Expected Outcome:** Develop an understanding of the capabilities of MintPy, expected inputs and possible outputs, and control parameters. Furthermore, develop an intuition in running and examining the results from MintPy

**Assessment:**

1. Re-process an InSAR time-series (using the same San Francisco Bay dataset or a dataset of your choice) using smallbaselineApp, with the following:

   - Manually choose a reference point, with justifications of your choices.
   - Tropospheric correction of your choice [account setup is needed for pyaps/ERA5]
   - Solid Earth tides correction

2. Estimate a suite of time functions for the final displacement time-series, using time functions of your choice, e.g. annual, semi-annual (periodic functions), step functions, etc.
